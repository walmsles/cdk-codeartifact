# Tool Preferences

## Python Management
- Use `uv` for Python version management and virtual environments
- Prefer `uv` over pyenv, conda, or system Python for development
- Use `uv python install` to install Python versions
- Use `uv venv` to create virtual environments
- Use `uv pip` for package management within virtual environments

## Package Management
- Use `yarn` for Node.js projects (already configured)
- Use `uv` for Python projects and dependencies
- Avoid mixing package managers within the same project

## Development Tools
- Use `uv` for Python tooling and script execution
- Maintain consistency across development environments
- Document tool versions in project configuration files
